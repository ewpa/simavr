Based on board_hd44780.

This example demonstrated how to attach a real or virtual serial device to
a simulation.  Useful expamples are GPS, Bluetooth, etc.

You will need three sessions to run this example.

In session 1, run the below.  This will create a virtual link between
special files ./tmp/pts-0 and /tmp/pts-1.
  socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/pts-0 pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/pts-1

In session 2, run the following to connect to one side of the link.
  screen /tmp/pts-0

In session 3, run the example simulation code.  This will connect the AVR
UART 0 to the other side of the link.

Now in session 2 (the local end of the virtual serial port) you can run
three commands.
  l text : to write the supplied text to the LCD.
  u text : to write the supplied text the the UART.
  q      : to quit.
